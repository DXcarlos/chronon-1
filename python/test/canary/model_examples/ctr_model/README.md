# CTR Model
Small toy model to help us test various model training and deployment integration points.

## Building training Python src distribution
In the model dir:
```bash
$ python setup.py sdist
...
$ gsutil cp dist/test_ctr_model-1.0.tar.gz gs://zipline-warehouse-models/builds/
```

## Building Custom Serving container

We use [Vertex's Custom Prediction Routines](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-prediction-routines) to help build a custom serving container. This is primarily to help us use customized input / output mapping for inbound requests for inference and model outputs.
To build the container:
```bash
$ cd serving
$ export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64
$ python build_container.py canary-443022 canary-images v1
...
✓ Container built successfully: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/canary-443022/canary-images/ctr-predictor:v1
Pushing to Artifact Registry...
✓ Container pushed successfully!

Image URI: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/canary-443022/canary-images/ctr-predictor:v1
```

This image URI is what we have set in the test/canary/models/gcp/click_through_rate.py file under the Serve.

## Testing
Once the model is deployed, you can trigger an inference call via curl / GCloud's Vertex Model Web UI. URL looks like:
`https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/canary-443022/locations/us-central1/endpoints/$endpointID:predict`
